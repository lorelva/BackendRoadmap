/*
	EXPLANATION ABOUT FUNCTIONALLITY OF THE PART OF CODE --> reverse = string(value) + reverse
	STRING EXAMPLE: "hello"

	1.- For range iterates for each character of the string

	2.- Then first iteration:
		FIRST CHARACTER--> H

		Assign to variables:
		value = h
		string(value) = h (is like adding to an array)

		string(value) adding to reverse, so...
		reverse = "h"

	3.- Second iteration:
		SECOND CHARACTER: E

		value before = h
		Assign to variables:
		value = e
		string(value) = e + h
		reverse = "e h"

	4.- Third and fourth iteration:
		THIRD AND FOURTH CHARACTER: L
		value before = e

		Assign to variables:
		value = l
		string(value) =  l + e + h
		reverse = "l e h"

		FOURTH CHARACTER: L
		value before = l

		Assign to variables:
		value = l
		string(value) =  l + l + e + h
		reverse = "l l e h"

	5.- Fifth iteration:
		FIFTH CHARACTER: O
		value before = l

		Assign to variables:
		value = o
		string(value) =  o + l + l + e + h
		reverse = "o l l e h"

	6.- Final Content of the variable reverse = olleh
